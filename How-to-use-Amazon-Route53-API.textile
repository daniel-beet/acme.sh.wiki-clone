            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "route53:GetHostedZone",
                "route53:ListHostedZones",
                "route53:ListHostedZonesByName",
                "route53:GetHostedZoneCount",
                "route53:ChangeResourceRecordSets",
                "route53:ListResourceRecordSets"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

Validate the policy and Click Create.
